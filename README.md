# Pavement-Marking-Identification-with-CV

This is the Capstone project I did during Fall 2022 with four of my other classmates. 
Our client for this project was NYC Department of Transportation, and they also provided the original data for us. 
The code of this project is not listed in this repository for the purpose of our client. 

The process of this project can be summarized in this flow chart:
